# Real Time International Space Station Tracker

## What is it?

This is one of the exercises of the MITxPro-MERN course, on the "Asynchronous Programming" module.

This exercise consists of using a map service (mapbox in this case) and to make asynchronous call to an API service. With these two services, a bus route is tracked in real time.

## Installaion

To run this code, simply fork and clone this repo; then run the index.html file using a server (everything the repo needs to run is in the files that you will be downloading when cloning it).

## Roadmap

- Push signals to know when the ISS is near you.
- Advertisment can be added to fund the development.
