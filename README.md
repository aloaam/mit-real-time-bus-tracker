## What is it?

---

This is one of the exercises of the MITxPro-MERN course, on the "Styles and Bootstap" module.

This exercise consists of creating two eyeballs (using just CSS) and make them follow the mouse movements, as if it was a person looking at the it.

## Installaion

---

To run this code, simply fork and clone this repo, and run the index.html file using a server (everything the repo needs to run is in the files that you will be downloading when cloning the repo).

## Roadmap

---

- Advertisment can be added to fund the development
